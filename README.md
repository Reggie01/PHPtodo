# PHP MVC

* My first attempt using php to make an app using mvc design.*

## Extra Resources
* Im using a skeleton MVC from [phpacademy](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfdtiltiRHWGXVHXX09fxXDi-DqInchFD).  My project has little resemblance to the authors original skeleton.  If you look at app/core/App.php you should see the skeleton.

## Tools/Libs
* The template engine is [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/). It is very similar to [jinga2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) a python template engine. I chose Twig because I had some exposure to jinga2 template engine.
* 7/23 - downloaded [Xdebug] (http://www.xdebug.org/index.php) debugger tool
* 7/23 - downloaded [NetBeansIDE 8.0] (https://netbeans.org/) ide
