# PHP MVC

## Todo App
My first attempt using MVC to build todo list.
I have two main goals for building this app.
* learn more about MVC architecture by building web app in PHP without MVC framework.
* learn php

## Tools/Libs
* The template engine is [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/). It is very similar to [jinga2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) a python template engine. I chose Twig because I had some exposure to jinga2 template engine.
* 7/23 - downloaded [Xdebug] (http://www.xdebug.org/index.php) debugger tool
* 7/23 - downloaded [NetBeansIDE 8.0] (https://netbeans.org/) ide
* [Composer] (https://getcomposer.org/) project dependency manager

## Extra Resources
* Im using a skeleton MVC from [phpacademy](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfdtiltiRHWGXVHXX09fxXDi-DqInchFD). Same folder structure and majority of the file app/core/App.php is the same.
